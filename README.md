# decimal-binaryConverter

## Softwares needed
Any compiler that can run the C language 

**Note** : The max decimal value that can be converted is 999. 
  If the value is bigger than 999, the value in the variable i will be beyond the scope of an integer datatype. Therfore a garbage value will be returned.
